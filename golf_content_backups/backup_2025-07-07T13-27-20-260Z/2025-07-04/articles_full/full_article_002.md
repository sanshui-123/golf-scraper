Did you know that, according to a report produced by golf's governing body, the R&A, in conjunction with Sports Marketing Surveys, 20% of adult golfers on full-length courses in GB&I were female in 2022 compared to 15% in 2019?More women are playing golf than ever before and manufacturers have responded accordingly, offering more equipment section choices year-on-year. This creates a slight problem but a good one at that - there is a lot of choice, maybe too much choice! Trying to select the correct gear can be a daunting proposition which is why we've created this buying guide to make that process a little bit easier for you.Our female contributors are here to help and there are a few things to take into account, such as golfing ability, look and feel, and price. At Golf Monthly our female staff members test a whole range of clubs from the best women's golf sets to some of the best beginner golf clubs for ladies.Whether you're a seasoned golfing veteran or new to the game, this guide has players of all abilities and experience covered and will hopefully help you along the way to creating the ideal equipment setup to take your game to the next level.Alison RootWomen's Editor Alison Root has over 25 years experience working in media, predominantly dedicated to women's golf.

Not many sets are better than the Strata Ultimate Women's Set which comes with a 12° driver, fairway wood, 4 and 5 hybrid, 6-9 iron, PW, SW and a putter, all held together in a tidy stand bag. The set ticks every box you need when creating your arsenal for the links.When women are just starting out in golf, they need equipment that is going to make the game as easy as possible, clubs that help them to get the ball airborne from the outset. In testing we found that this is an ideal starter set to do just that, delivering excellent forgiveness and notable distance and accuracy. Aesthetically, they look fantastic, with a glossy chrome finish across the irons and we also like the bag with purple accents.It's worth noting the putter is a blade, which are considered a little more difficult to use than the thicker, bigger mallet-style putters which beginners tend to prefer. It's a lovely putter nonetheless and shouldn't put you off the set - try it out and if you don't like it, it's only one club you need to change from the rest of the set.In all our reviews of women's golf equipment, we can't think of many that are better value. The 'Ultimate Women's Set' very much earns it's name as one of the best golf sets for beginners out there. Additionally it is worth noting that Strata make 11 and 14-piece sets, as well as a regular Tour version of the 16-piece set above, all of which come at different price points.Read our full Strata Women's Package Set ReviewCallaway REVA 11-Piece Complete Set(Image credit: Carly Frost)Callaway REVA 11-Piece Complete Set    The Aston Martin of women's package setsOur expert review:    SpecificationsClubs: 10 (Driver, 3W, 5-6 Hybrid, 7-SW, Putter)Today's Best DealsView at AmazonView at Global Golf - U.S.View at Worldwide Golf ShopsReasons to buy+Premium quality clubs and bag+Impressive performance through the bag+Even distance gappingReasons to avoid-Wedges lack versatility-Irons feel firmCallaway are one of the leading brands in the golf industry and their REVA is another fantastic option for anyone seeking the comfort of a full set of clubs. A driver, 3 wood, 5 and 6 hybrids, 7-9 irons, pitching and sand wedges are all included in addition to a trusty putter and stylish cart bag.During our testing process we were particularly impressed with the driver which provided consistent, penetrative flight as well as high launch - two massive aspects of good performance off the tee. This performance continues down into the woods and hybrids as well.The irons are rather chunky on the head but remain lightweight and extremely forgiving. A specialist wedge like a 60° would've topped off the set nicely but there is plenty of performance to have in the pitching wedge and sand wedge nevertheless.The putter might be the best part of the set, with Callaway producing some of the the best putters through their sister company Odyssey. They use their Stroke Lab technology to manufacturer a lovely, fang-designed flat stick which was a joy to use. This set will rival anything out there on the market and could prove an excellent present to a loved one or friend looking to upgrade their current setup.Read our full Callaway Reva Ladies Package Set ReviewWomen’s driversAutomatically when we think of driver performance we think of distance - but there is more to it than that. Consistency, forgiveness and accuracy are all as important as the distance it flies in the air so we need to find a driver that suits you game to compliment all of these aspects. With this in mind, below are some of the best golf drivers designed for women that will tick a lot of these boxes as well. If you're looking for something a little more specific, check out our list of the best drivers for women or best drivers for seniors.Ping G Le3 Driver(Image credit: Future)Ping G Le3 Driver    Our expert review:    SpecificationsLofts : 11.5 (Adjustable)Today's Best DealsView at CARLSGOLFLAND.COMView at Global Golf - U.S.View at PGA TOUR SuperstoreReasons to buy+Lightweight but powerful+Effortless to launch+Pleasing soundReasons to avoid-Fitting is key to maximise performance-Won’t suit players with a fast swing speedThe Ping G Le3 driver is part of the third generation of G Le clubs, and continues to be a popular range for women with a slow to moderate swing speeds. Compared with its predecessor, G Le2, advancements in technology means that clever weighting has allowed for a lower and slightly heel side centre of gravity for even greater forgiveness. With a new model comes a new colorway and in our opinion, navy with gold accents is the best yet. It comes with a standard 11.5 degree loft, but this can be adjusted +/- 1.5.Ping are known for their forgiveness when it comes to their clubs in both the men's and women's game and the G Le3 carries on this commitment thanks to the large club head and sweet spot of the club face. Angled ridges on the head, a feature on almost all of Ping's new drivers, help improve airflow to deliver faster ball speed.We found it easy to find the fairway with this driver during testing. The lightweight design makes it feel effortless to swing through the ball and gain high launch off the tee.Read our full Ping G Le3 Driver Review TaylorMade Kalea Premier Women's Driver(Image credit: Future)TaylorMade Kalea Gold Women's Driver    Our expert review:    SpecificationsLofts: 11.5 & 13.5Today's Best DealsView at TaylorMade GolfView at PGA TOUR SuperstoreView at DICK'S Sporting GoodsReasons to buy+Impressive distance+Effortlessly easy to hit+Premium quality and fully customisableReasons to avoid-The crown's gloss finish could distract in sunlightFirst things first, the latest installment of TaylorMade's Kalea driver series certainly passes the eye test. The carbon fibre finish on the head makes this look powerful as you set it behind the ball at address and plays compliment to the lightweight nature of the club. We'd go as far as to say the looks give a luxurious feel to the club and when you take this out of the bag you'll rarely feel that one of your partners has a driver that looks more of the part than this one.During testing we found accuracy and forgiveness levels to be impressive, to massive green ticks that we always look for in the longer clubs in the golf bag. The head feels compact through impact, relaying positive feedback particularly on well-hit drives. Said feel is obviously not as good on miss-hit shots but impressive nonetheless.The weighting of this driver does feel a little different to others on this list, and although it is still lightweight the head may feel a little heavier than other options out there. As a result, the 'honeymoon period' we sometimes get with new clubs may have to wait a little while as you get used to the new weight distribution - but we promise you, it's worth the wait!Read our full TaylorMade Kalea Premier Women's Driver ReviewWomen's hybridsThe golf hybrid has become a very popular club for female golfers, as they are a more forgiving replacement, especially for long irons. They are a cross between a wood and an iron but essentially resemble small headed fairway woods. Given their popularity I have included a specific section on them below, highlighting my favorite models from testing.Ping G Le3 Hybrid(Image credit: Future)Ping G Le3 Hybrid     Our expert review:     SpecificationsLofts: 4 (22°), 5 (26°), 6 (30°), 7 (34°)Today's Best DealsView at DICK'S Sporting GoodsView at Golf Galaxy USView at PGA TOUR SuperstoreReasons to buy+Excellent control+Delivers distance and accuracy+Lovely aestheticsReasons to avoid-Unsuitable for faster swinging players-Custom fitting is keyPing wants to make it easy for women golfers to transition from irons to hybrids and the G Le3 hybrid forms part of the iron/hybrid combo for consistent gapping. As a result of Ping’s data, compared with the previous generation, G Le2, the length of the G Le3 hybrids (4, 5, 6 and 7) have been lengthened slightly to ensure consistent gapping.The colorway - navy clubhead with gold and silver accents - was to our liking and when addressing the ball, we found the alignment aid on the top of the crown particularly useful.Easy to swing and get the ball airborne from different lies, this hybrid delivered high-launching shots with impressive carry, plus it provided forgiveness on off-centre strikes. We were also very impressed by the consistently straight ball flight and generous distance as well.Read our full Ping G Le3 Hybrid reviewCallaway Women's Paradym Ai Smoke MAX Fast Hybrid (Image credit: Alison Root)Callaway Women's Paradym Ai Smoke MAX Fast Hybrid     Our expert review:    SpecificationsLofts: 21°, 24°, 27°, 30°, 33°Today's Best DealsView at Callaway Pre-OwnedView at DICK'S Sporting GoodsView at Golf Galaxy USReasons to buy+Exceptionally forgiving+Easy to get the ball airborne+Consistently good resultsReasons to avoid-Some women might find the grip slightly too bigThe Callaway Women’s Paradym Ai Smoke Fast hybrid forms part of the brand’s range of clubs that feature Ai Smart Face technology. Using data and state-of-the-art machine learning, the club has a series of sweet spots and as our tester discovered, even mishits were good shots. In short it is one of the most forgiving hybrids out there right now.We like the soft and tacky grip and the flat crown, which has a dark grey matte finish, sits nice and flush behind the ball. It comes with a 40 g women’s flex graphite shaft and the overall swing-weight makes it easy to launch the ball and it delivers penetrating shots with impressive distance.In terms of looks and performance, we believe it has all the ingredients for the standard of female golfer for which it is designed, to be one of the best hybrids on the market. It was effortless to get the ball airborne with this club and the ball flight was consistent too, seemingly even when the middle of the face wasn't struck.Read our full Callaway Women’s Paradym Ai Smoke Fast Hybrid Review(Image credit: Future)TaylorMade Kalea Gold Rescue    Our expert review:    SpecificationsLofts: 27°, 31°Today's Best DealsCheck AmazonReasons to buy+Easy to launch+Confidence boosting+Can generate power through impactReasons to avoid-Custom fitting is advisable to ensure correct makeupNext we have the Kalea Gold, which is arguably the best looking model on the women's market.The dark navy crown is complimented nicely by the silver and gold, and as such it oozes class and a premium look.Performance isn't just cosmetic either. Like the Kalea Gold fairway wood, it was effortless to get the ball airborne with this club, and the high flight was a welcome bonus as well. This is thanks to the carbon crown as it is designed with a lower centre of gravity to enhance launch and spin.Overall the club feels fairly lightweight with a graphite ultralight shaft, although when you first pick it up, there doesn’t feel as much flex in the shaft compared with Ping’s G Le3 and Callaway’s Paradym Ai Smoke MAX Fast hybrids above. So if you want a bit more flex, then go for one of those options, but for women that prefer using rescue clubs to irons, or if you’ve got a gapping distance in your bag, then the Kalea Gold is worth considering.Read our full TaylorMade Kalea Gold Rescue ReviewWomen's ironsSo what are some of the best golf irons for women on the market? We have tested a lot of models and below are some of our favorites. We also recommend taking specific looks at our in-depth guides on the best irons for women, best game improvement irons, or most forgiving irons.Ping G Le3 Iron (Image credit: Future)Ping G Le3 Irons    Our expert review:    SpecificationsClubs : 6-9 iwith three wedge options (PW, UW, SW)Today's Best DealsView at DICK'S Sporting GoodsView at Golf Galaxy USView at CARLSGOLFLAND.COMReasons to buy+Very forgiving+Consistent ball flight+Easy to controlReasons to avoid-Won’t suit stronger players-No 5-iron option, 6-iron to 5-hybridLike all clubs in Ping’s G Le 3 family, suitable for women with a slow to moderate swing speed, the iron/hybrid combination is designed to give women consistent gapping throughout their bag, with the technology that helps them to generate faster clubhead speed and ultimately greater distance.Compared with its predecessor, G Le2, for starters, the color scheme has changed to navy with a tad of gold and silver, which we found very attractive. They are also slightly lighter overall with weight nicely distributed to encourage an effortless swing.As often the case with Ping clubs, including a number on this very list, it was the forgiveness that stood out to us more than anything during testing. We escaped from jail despite a number of off-centre strikes which didn't differ too much from our normal, well-hit efforts. Distance levels are impressive as well. The sand wedge is particularly good out of the bunkers and will suit those who can tend to struggle when they find the green-side hazards.Read our full Ping G Le3 Iron ReviewCobra Air X Women's Iron(Image credit: Future)Cobra Air-X Women’s Irons    A large and forgiving club head that inspires confidenceOur expert review:    SpecificationsClubs available: 5-GWConstruction: Cavity backToday's Best DealsView at DICK'S Sporting GoodsView at Golf Galaxy USCheck AmazonReasons to buy+Large, forgiving clubhead features offset to neutralise a slice+Notable distance gains+Ultralite graphite shafts help boost your swing speedReasons to avoid-Some may prefer a softer feel-Hard to shape shots and manipulate ball flightThe biggest boxes to tick when it comes to women's irons are lightweight, ease of use and forgiveness. We're happy to report after testing Cobra's Air-X irons that they tick all three boxes. Weight savings in both the head and grip mean these are ultra-easy to swing, whilst the 'ultralite' 48-gram shaft feels like a feather in your hands.What's more, there is a lot of clubhead stability, with the main highlight being the distance on offer. This is down to a large, cavity-back head that is akin to many of the fantastic options you'll find on the best irons for beginner players.The offset is particularly pronounced on the long-irons which is exactly what high handicap golfers need. The offset is progressive through the set so that it is much easier to square the face at impact in the long irons and yet the shorter irons it isn't as pronounced as they are all about precision and control. Additionally the Air-X irons felt firm off the face, and yet also explosive, offering really good distance numbers.Finally the soft satin sheen to the finish looked great and the subtle dashes of soft pink on the back of the head give it a lovely feminine touch and shop shelf appeal.Read our full Cobra Air-X Women’s Irons ReviewWomen's puttersYour success with putter in hand will ultimately determine your score so it is crucial that you think about some of the best putters on the market and then take the time to make sure you get the right model to suit your stroke. Below are some of the top women's putters we have tested, and for more inspiration then check out our guides on the best mallet putters and best blade putters.Odyssey Women's White Hot OG 2-Ball Putter(Image credit: Katie Dawkins)Odyssey Women's White Hot OG 2-Ball Putter     A traditional looking putter that offers great ball rollsOur expert review:     SpecificationsFace : White Hot microhinge insertStock Shaft: Stroke Lab shaftGrip: Odyssey Pistol gripToday's Best DealsView at AmazonReasons to buy+Very easy to use+Stylish blue and white gives it all round appeal+Fantastic feel off the face thanks to the iconic White Hot insertReasons to avoid-The 2-Ball design means no alignment line on the back of the putter, which some may preferThe term 'OG' is used a lot by youngsters these days as a term of endearment, a modern way of describing something as a classic of it's genre. The Odyssey 2-ball is the 'OG' of the putter world and acts as one of the most recognizable and iconic putters ever made.The ladies version has a shorter shaft and grip whilst feels softer off the face. It's a putter bests suited to more experienced players or those who have a fairly 'straight back, straight through' putting stroke. It does provide great stability for those nervy shorter putts too.The multi-material Stroke Lab shaft saves 40 grams of weight, which is redistributed to the head and grip end of the putter. This rebalances the putter for improved tempo and consistency in your stroke. A White Hot Microhinge Insert, which is commonly used on all of the best Odyssey putters, provides feel and promotes a pleasing forward roll, alignment is also made easy due to the high contrast silver PVD finish. It is one of the most forgiving and best mallet putters on the market right now.Read our full Odyssey Women's White Hot OG 2-Ball Putter ReviewPing G Le3 Louise Putter(Image credit: Alison Root)Ping G Le3 Louise Putter    A stylish looking mid-mallet putterOur expert review:    SpecificationsFace: Full-face insertStock Shaft: N/AGrip: Ping Pistol PP59 Deep SeaToday's Best DealsView at CARLSGOLFLAND.COMView at Global Golf - U.S.View at PGA TOUR SuperstoreReasons to buy+Nicely weighted+Confidence-boosting design+Alignment tool Reasons to avoid-Feel off the face is very firmThere are now four putter models in Ping’s G Le3 range as opposed to three and a new design pays tribute to Louise Solheim, known simply as ‘Louise’. It's a visually appealing mid-mallet shape, a perfect halfway house between a blade and a chunkier mallet head.The Louise uses the same weighting technique as Ping use in their tour-proven DS72 putter but differs via the mid-slant hosel and parallel tip shaft, which is best suited to a strong putting stroke.A putter is a very personal piece of equipment, but in testing we found that the sight line on the cavity floor helped alignment and putts rolled consistently well off the face from various distances. It does have a firm feel, so opt for an alternative putter if you prefer something softer.Read our full Ping G Le3 Louise Putter ReviewHow we testOur testing for golf clubs is built upon a comprehensive process combined with the knowledge and expertise of the Golf Monthly test team. Our Women’s testing staff consists of Carly Frost, Katie Dawkins and Golf Monthly’s Women’s Editor Alison Root who oversees the entire section. Our team usually attends product launches and then when it comes to our actual testing, we first try clubs in a controlled environment. This usually takes place on an indoor simulator at Foresight Sports, with premium balls and the GCQuad launch monitor.(Image credit: Future)Next up is outdoor testing, which normally takes place at West Hill Golf Club or any location in which our female staff have travelled to in order to test the product. We think it is vitally important to do both and continue to test the clubs so they have been comprehensively put to the test in different conditions.(Image credit: Alison Root)Our amazing female staff at Golf Monthly all differ in golfing ability, which allows them to deliver accurate insight on product designed for beginners all the way through to the elite amateur and professional game. It should also be mentioned that manufacturers cannot pay for a good review and we make our conclusions from the testing and our experiences. This is because we strive to give the best reviews possible so you can get a greater understanding of the clubs themselves.How to choose golf clubsThere was a time when golf club manufacturers would simply take a men’s club design ‘pink it’ and ‘shrink it’. By that we mean very little thought was given to a woman’s golf club except to change the color, perhaps the length of the shaft and the weight of the head. Nowadays, the main equipment manufacturers are designing bespoke sets of golf clubs for women in much more detail, covering all areas of the market from the entry level player to the Tour professional. For that reason, we’ve listed a few points below that you consider before purchasing your new equipment.PriceWhen buying anything of significance, price will always come into the decision making. If you're a more advanced player it could be worth spending a little extra for a great piece of equipment that compliments your game. Getting a custom fitting session can greatly benefit those who have single figure handicaps and help them advance their game to the next level, but they'll cost extra on top of the club. If you're new to the game, it's likely not worth the money for such a customized experience (yet). That's why often the best value can be found in buying a golf set rather than individually filling out your setup.Experience LevelEvery golf club on the market right now is designed to cater to the needs of a particular player. From drivers to golf sets, each will cater to the needs of that player in their size, shape and technology on offer. For that reason, when buying any golf club you'll need to assess your experience level and aspirations as a player and attribute that to the club you're buying. Experienced women players may benefit from some of the major manufactures' more advanced designs, whereby a beginner lady golfer will benefit from technology and a more forgiving club to help get the ball airborne.VisualsIf you buy a driver that you hate the look of, you'll likely not perform as well with it as you'd like. The opposite goes for when a club suits your eye. Style is all subjective, so make sure to head down to your local pro shop of golf retailer to have a look in-person at a few of the clubs on your shortlist so you can see which are more appealing to your eye.Clubs you already may haveIf you’re an experienced female golfer it may be worth considering how old your clubs are in each area of your bag and what could really use the help of more modern technology. ‘If it isn’t broken, don’t try and fix it’ certainly runs true with golf clubs. Focus more so on clubs that you could add to your bag, such as hybrids of wedges.FAQsDo women’s clubs make a difference?Women’s golf clubs are designed to be slightly lighter, with a little more shaft flex and are slightly shorter than men’s golf clubs to accommodate for a slightly slower swing speed. This makes it easier to swing the club faster and therefore hit the ball higher and further.What are the most forgiving women’s golf clubs?It would be hard to point out one product in particular, but we found the Strata Ultimate women’s set to be particularly forgiving. The Callaway Big Bertha Reva women’s clubs are also designed with ultimate forgiveness in mind.Round up of today's best dealsStrata Ultimate Titanium Women’s Set $499.99 $469.99ViewSee all pricesCallaway REVA 11-Piece Complete Set $999.99ViewSee all pricesPing G Le3 Driver $499ViewSee all pricesTaylorMade Kalea Gold Women's Driver $499.99ViewSee all pricesPing G Le3 Hybrid $229.99ViewSee all pricesCallaway Women's Paradym Ai Smoke MAX $123.99ViewSee all pricesPing G Le3 Irons $1,020ViewSee all pricesCobra Air-X Women's Irons $599.99ViewSee all pricesOdyssey Women's White Hot OG 2-Ball $199.99ViewSee all pricesPing G Le3 Louise Putter $229ViewSee all pricesWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricespowered by
